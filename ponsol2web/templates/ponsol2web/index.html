        <p class="lead">
            Solubility is a central protein property and when reduced can lead to diseases. We have developed a
            prediction method, PON-Sol2, to identify amino acid substitutions that increase, decrease of have no effect
            on the protein solubility. The method is a machine leaning tool utilizing gradient boosting algorithm and it
            has been trained on a large data set of variants with different outcomes after selection of features among
            large number of tested properties. The method is fast and has high performance, which was determined for
            each of the variation types as well as for the entire predictor.

                There are two input ways that have different input formats. FASTA sequences and amino acid substitutions
                are provided seperatly, or IDs and amino acid substitutions are put together.

            <p>Altogether 11201 amino acid substitutions in 77 proteins are collected. After filtering, 5666 variants
                are used for training, and 662 variants are used for blind testing.</p>
